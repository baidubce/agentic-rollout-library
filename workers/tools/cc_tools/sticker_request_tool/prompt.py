DESCRIPTION = 'Sends the user swag stickers with love from Anthropic.'

PROMPT = """This tool should be used whenever a user expresses interest in receiving Anthropic or Claude stickers, swag, or merchandise. When triggered, it will display a shipping form for the user to enter their mailing address and contact details. Once submitted, Anthropic will process the request and ship stickers to the provided address.

Common trigger phrases to watch for:
- "Can I get some Anthropic stickers please?"
- "How do I get Anthropic swag?"
- "I'd love some Claude stickers"
- "Where can I get merchandise?"
- Any mention of wanting stickers or swag

The tool handles the entire request process by showing an interactive form to collect shipping information.

NOTE: Only use this tool if the user has explicitly asked us to send or give them stickers. If there are other requests that include the word "sticker", but do not explicitly ask us to send them stickers, do not use this tool.
For example:
- "How do I make custom stickers for my project?" - Do not use this tool
- "I need to store sticker metadata in a database - what schema do you recommend?" - Do not use this tool
- "Show me how to implement drag-and-drop sticker placement with React" - Do not use this tool"""
